       Amazon CloudWatch monitors your Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources and
       the applications you run on AWS in real time. You can use CloudWatch to
       collect  and track metrics, which are the variables you want to measure
       for your resources and applications.

       CloudWatch alarms send notifications or automatically  change  the  re-
       sources you are monitoring based on rules that you define. For example,
       you can monitor the CPU usage and disk reads and writes of your  Amazon
       EC2  instances.  Then,  use  this  data to determine whether you should
       launch additional instances to handle increased load. You can also  use
       this data to stop under-used instances to save money.

       In  addition to monitoring the built-in metrics that come with AWS, you
       can monitor your own custom metrics. With  CloudWatch,  you  gain  sys-
       tem-wide visibility into resource utilization, application performance,
       and operational health.
