       Amazon  Lex  provides  both  build and runtime endpoints. Each endpoint
       provides a set of operations (API). Your conversational  bot  uses  the
       runtime  API  to understand user utterances (user input text or voice).
       For example, suppose a user says "I want pizza", your  bot  sends  this
       input  to  Amazon Lex using the runtime API. Amazon Lex recognizes that
       the user request is for the OrderPizza intent (one of the  intents  de-
       fined  in the bot). Then Amazon Lex engages in user conversation on be-
       half of the bot to elicit required information (slot  values,  such  as
       pizza  size  and  crust  type),  and then performs fulfillment activity
       (that you configured when you created the bot). You use the  build-time
       API  to create and manage your Amazon Lex bot. For a list of build-time
       operations, see the build-time API, .
