       Amazon  WorkMail  is  a  secure, managed business email and calendaring
       service with support for existing desktop and mobile email clients. You
       can access your email, contacts, and calendars using Microsoft Outlook,
       your browser, or other native iOS and Android email  applications.  You
       can  integrate WorkMail with your existing corporate directory and con-
       trol both the keys that encrypt your data and  the  location  in  which
       your data is stored.

       The WorkMail API is designed for the following scenarios:

       +o Listing and describing organizations

       +o Managing users

       +o Managing groups

       +o Managing resources

       All  WorkMail  API  operations  are  Amazon-authenticated  and certifi-
       cate-signed. They not only require the use of the AWS SDK, but also al-
       low  for  the exclusive use of AWS Identity and Access Management users
       and roles to help facilitate access, trust, and permission policies. By
       creating  a  role and allowing an IAM user to access the WorkMail site,
       the IAM user gains full administrative visibility into the entire Work-
       Mail  organization (or as set in the IAM policy). This includes, but is
       not limited to, the  ability  to  create,  update,  and  delete  users,
       groups,  and resources. This allows developers to perform the scenarios
       listed above, as well as give users the ability to grant  access  on  a
       selective basis using the IAM model.
