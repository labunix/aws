       Welcome  to  the AWS Audit Manager API reference. This guide is for de-
       velopers who need detailed information about the AWS Audit Manager  API
       operations, data types, and errors.

       AWS Audit Manager is a service that provides automated evidence collec-
       tion so that you can continuously audit your AWS usage, and assess  the
       effectiveness  of your controls to better manage risk and simplify com-
       pliance.

       AWS Audit Manager provides pre-built frameworks that structure and  au-
       tomate  assessments for a given compliance standard. Frameworks include
       a pre-built collection of controls with descriptions and testing proce-
       dures, which are grouped according to the requirements of the specified
       compliance standard or regulation. You can  also  customize  frameworks
       and controls to support internal audits with unique requirements.
