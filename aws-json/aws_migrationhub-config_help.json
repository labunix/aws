       The  AWS  Migration Hub home region APIs are available specifically for
       working with your Migration Hub home region. You can use these APIs  to
       determine  a  home  region, as well as to create and work with controls
       that describe the home region.

       +o You must make API calls for write actions (create, notify, associate,
         disassociate, import, or put) while in your home region, or a HHoommeeRRee--

       +o API calls for read actions (list, describe,  stop,  and  delete)  are
         permitted outside of your home region.

       +o If  you  call a write API outside the home region, an IInnvvaalliiddIInnppuuttEExx--

         Hub home region.
