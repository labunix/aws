       AWS  Snow  Family is a petabyte-scale data transport solution that uses
       secure  devices  to  transfer  large  amounts  of  data  between   your
       on-premises data centers and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).
       The Snow commands described here provide access to the same functional-
       ity  that is available in the AWS Snow Family Management Console, which
       enables you to create and manage jobs for a Snow  device.  To  transfer
       data  locally  with a Snow device, you'll need to use the Snowball Edge
       client or the Amazon S3 API Interface for Snowball or  AWS  OpsHub  for
       Snow Family. For more information, see the _U_s_e_r _G_u_i_d_e .
