       AWS  Transfer Family is a fully managed service that enables the trans-
       fer of files over the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), File Transfer  Pro-
       tocol  over  SSL  (FTPS),  or Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol
       (SFTP) directly into and out of Amazon Simple Storage  Service  (Amazon
       S3).  AWS  helps you seamlessly migrate your file transfer workflows to
       AWS Transfer Family by integrating with  existing  authentication  sys-
       tems, and providing DNS routing with Amazon Route 53 so nothing changes
       for your customers and partners, or their applications. With your  data
       in  Amazon S3, you can use it with AWS services for processing, analyt-
       ics, machine learning, and archiving. Getting started with AWS Transfer
       Family is easy since there is no infrastructure to buy and set up.
