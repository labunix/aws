       Amazon  GuardDuty is a continuous security monitoring service that ana-
       lyzes and processes the following data  sources:  VPC  Flow  Logs,  AWS
       CloudTrail  event logs, and DNS logs. It uses threat intelligence feeds
       (such as lists of malicious IPs and domains) and  machine  learning  to
       identify  unexpected,  potentially unauthorized, and malicious activity
       within your AWS environment. This can include issues  like  escalations
       of privileges, uses of exposed credentials, or communication with mali-
       cious IPs, URLs, or domains. For example, GuardDuty can detect  compro-
       mised EC2 instances that serve malware or mine bitcoin.

       GuardDuty  also  monitors AWS account access behavior for signs of com-
       promise. Some examples of this are unauthorized infrastructure  deploy-
       ments  such  as  EC2 instances deployed in a Region that has never been
       used, or unusual API calls like a  password  policy  change  to  reduce
       password strength.

       GuardDuty  informs you of the status of your AWS environment by produc-
       ing security findings that you can view in  the  GuardDuty  console  or
       through  Amazon  CloudWatch  events.  For  more  information, see the *
