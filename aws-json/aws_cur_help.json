       AWS Cost and Usage reports track the monthly AWS costs and usage  asso-
       ciated  with  your AWS account. The report contains line items for each
       unique combination of AWS product, usage type, and operation that  your
       AWS  account  uses.  You can configure the AWS Cost and Usage report to
       show only the data that you want, using the AWS Cost and Usage API.
