       AWS  IoT Core Device Advisor is a cloud-based, fully managed test capa-
       bility for validating IoT devices during device  software  development.
       Device  Advisor  provides  pre-built tests that you can use to validate
       IoT devices for reliable and secure connectivity with AWS IoT Core  be-
       fore  deploying devices to production. By using Device Advisor, you can
       confirm that your devices can connect to AWS IoT Core, follow  security
       best  practices  and,  if applicable, receive software updates from IoT
       Device Management. You can also download signed  qualification  reports
       to  submit  to the AWS Partner Network to get your device qualified for
       the AWS Partner Device Catalog without the need to send your device  in
       and wait for it to be tested.
