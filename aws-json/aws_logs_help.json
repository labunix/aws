       You  can  use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to monitor, store, and access your
       log files from EC2 instances, AWS CloudTrail, or other sources. You can
       then  retrieve  the  associated log data from CloudWatch Logs using the
       CloudWatch console, CloudWatch Logs commands in the AWS CLI, CloudWatch
       Logs API, or CloudWatch Logs SDK.

       You can use CloudWatch Logs to:

         Logs to monitor applications and systems using log data. For example,
         CloudWatch Logs can track the number of errors that occur in your ap-
         plication logs and send you a notification whenever the rate  of  er-
         rors  exceeds a threshold that you specify. CloudWatch Logs uses your
         log data for monitoring so no code changes are required. For example,
         you  can monitor application logs for specific literal terms (such as
         "NullReferenceException") or count the number  of  occurrences  of  a
         literal term at a particular position in log data (such as "404" sta-
         tus codes in an Apache access log). When the term you  are  searching
         for is found, CloudWatch Logs reports the data to a CloudWatch metric
         that you specify.

         CloudWatch  and  receive  notifications of particular API activity as
         captured by CloudTrail. You can use the notification to perform trou-
         bleshooting.

       +o AArrcchhiivvee lloogg ddaattaa : You can use CloudWatch Logs to store your log data
         in highly durable storage. You can change the log  retention  setting
         so  that  any  log  events  older than this setting are automatically
         deleted. The CloudWatch Logs agent makes it easy to quickly send both
         rotated  and non-rotated log data off of a host and into the log ser-
         vice. You can then access the raw log data when you need it.
