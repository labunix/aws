       AWS  Import/Export  accelerates  transferring large amounts of data be-
       tween the AWS cloud and portable storage devices that you mail  to  us.
       AWS  Import/Export transfers data directly onto and off of your storage
       devices using Amazon's high-speed internal network  and  bypassing  the
       Internet.  For  large data sets, AWS Import/Export is often faster than
       Internet transfer and more cost effective than upgrading  your  connec-
       tivity.
