       AWS  Compute Optimizer is a service that analyzes the configuration and
       utilization metrics of your AWS compute  resources,  such  as  EC2  in-
       stances, Auto Scaling groups, AWS Lambda functions, and Amazon EBS vol-
       umes. It reports whether your resources are optimal, and generates  op-
       timization  recommendations  to reduce the cost and improve the perfor-
       mance of your workloads. Compute Optimizer also  provides  recent  uti-
       lization  metric data, as well as projected utilization metric data for
       the recommendations, which you can use to evaluate which recommendation
       provides the best price-performance trade-off. The analysis of your us-
       age patterns can help you decide when to move or  resize  your  running
       resources,  and  still meet your performance and capacity requirements.
