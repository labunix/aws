       AWS  Single  Sign-On  (SSO) OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a web service that
       enables a client (such as AWS CLI or a native application) to  register
       with  AWS  SSO.  The service also enables the client to fetch the users
       access token upon successful authentication and authorization with  AWS
       SSO.  This  service conforms with the OAuth 2.0 based implementation of
       the      device       authorization       grant       standard       (-

          AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for var-
          ious  programming  languages and platforms such as Java, Ruby, .Net,
          iOS, and Android. The SDKs provide a convenient way to  create  pro-
          grammatic  access to AWS SSO and other AWS services. For more infor-
          mation about the AWS SDKs, including how  to  download  and  install
          them, see _T_o_o_l_s _f_o_r _A_m_a_z_o_n _W_e_b _S_e_r_v_i_c_e_s .
