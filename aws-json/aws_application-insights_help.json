       Amazon  CloudWatch Application Insights is a service that helps you de-
       tect common problems with your applications. It enables you to pinpoint
       the source of issues in your applications (built with technologies such
       as Microsoft IIS, .NET, and Microsoft SQL Server), by providing key in-
       sights into detected problems.

       After  you  onboard  your  application, CloudWatch Application Insights
       identifies, recommends, and sets up metrics and logs.  It  continuously
       analyzes  and  correlates your metrics and logs for unusual behavior to
       surface actionable problems with your application. For example, if your
       application  is slow and unresponsive and leading to HTTP 500 errors in
       your Application Load Balancer (ALB), Application Insights informs  you
       that  a memory pressure problem with your SQL Server database is occur-
       ring. It bases this analysis on impactful metrics and log errors.
