       Security  Hub  provides  you  with a comprehensive view of the security
       state of your AWS environment and resources. It also provides you  with
       the  readiness  status  of your environment based on controls from sup-
       ported security standards. Security Hub collects security data from AWS
       accounts,  services,  and integrated third-party products and helps you
       analyze security trends in your environment  to  identify  the  highest
       priority  security issues. For more information about Security Hub, see
       the * _A_W_S _S_e_c_u_r_i_t_y _H_u_b _U_s_e_r _G_u_i_d_e * .

       When you use operations in the Security Hub API, the requests are  exe-
       cuted  only  in  the AWS Region that is currently active or in the spe-
       cific AWS Region that you specify in your request. Any configuration or
       settings change that results from the operation is applied only to that
       Region. To make the same change in other Regions, execute the same com-
       mand for each Region to apply the change to.

       For example, if your Region is set to uuss--wweesstt--22 , when you use ``  Cre-
       ateMembers `` to add a member account to Security Hub, the  association
       of  the  member  account with the master account is created only in the
       uuss--wweesstt--22 Region. Security Hub must be enabled for the  member  account
       in the same Region that the invitation was sent from.

       The  following throttling limits apply to using Security Hub API opera-
       tions.
