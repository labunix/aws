       This  AWS  CodeStar Connections API Reference provides descriptions and
       usage examples of the operations and data types for  the  AWS  CodeStar
       Connections  API.  You can use the connections API to work with connec-
       tions and installations.
          _C_o_n_n_e_c_t_i_o_n_s are configurations that you use to connect AWS resources
          to  external  code  repositories. Each connection is a resource that
          can be given to services  such  as  CodePipeline  to  connect  to  a
          third-party  repository  such as Bitbucket. For example, you can add
          the connection in CodePipeline so that  it  triggers  your  pipeline
          when a code change is made to your third-party code repository. Each
          connection is named and associated with a unique ARN that is used to
          reference the connection.

       When  you create a connection, the console initiates a third-party con-
       nection handshake. _I_n_s_t_a_l_l_a_t_i_o_n_s are the apps that are used to  conduct
       this  handshake.  For  example,  the  installation  for  the  Bitbucket
       provider type is the Bitbucket app. When you create a  connection,  you
       can choose an existing installation or create one.

       When you want to create a connection to an installed provider type such
       as GitHub Enterprise Server, you create a _h_o_s_t for your connections.

       You can work with connections by calling:

       +o CreateConnection , which creates a uniquely named connection that can
         be referenced by services such as CodePipeline.

       +o DeleteConnection , which deletes the specified connection.

       +o GetConnection  ,  which returns information about the connection, in-
         cluding the connection status.

       +o ListConnections , which lists the connections  associated  with  your
         account.

       You can work with hosts by calling:

       +o CreateHost  , which creates a host that represents the infrastructure
         where your provider is installed.

       +o DeleteHost , which deletes the specified host.

       +o GetHost , which returns information about  the  host,  including  the
         setup status.

       +o ListHosts , which lists the hosts associated with your account.

       You  can work with tags in AWS CodeStar Connections by calling the fol-
       lowing:

       +o ListTagsForResource , which gets information about  AWS  tags  for  a
         specified Amazon Resource Name (ARN) in AWS CodeStar Connections.

       +o TagResource  ,  which  adds  or  updates  tags  for a resource in AWS
         CodeStar Connections.

       +o UntagResource , which removes tags for a  resource  in  AWS  CodeStar
         Connections.
