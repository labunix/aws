       With  Application Auto Scaling, you can configure automatic scaling for
       the following resources:

       +o Amazon ECS services

       +o Amazon EC2 Spot Fleet requests

       +o Amazon EMR clusters

       +o Amazon AppStream 2.0 fleets

       +o Amazon DynamoDB tables and global secondary indexes throughput capac-
         ity

       +o Amazon Aurora Replicas

       +o Amazon SageMaker endpoint variants

       +o Custom resources provided by your own applications or services

       +o Amazon  Comprehend document classification and entity recognizer end-
         points

       +o AWS Lambda function provisioned concurrency

       +o Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra) tables

       +o Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka cluster storage

       The Application Auto Scaling service API includes three key sets of ac-
       tions:

       +o Register  and  manage  scalable  targets - Register AWS or custom re-
         sources as scalable targets (a resource that Application Auto Scaling
         can scale), set minimum and maximum capacity limits, and retrieve in-
         formation on existing scalable targets.

       +o Configure and manage automatic scaling - Define scaling  policies  to
         dynamically  scale  your  resources in response to CloudWatch alarms,
         schedule one-time or recurring scaling actions, and retrieve your re-
         cent scaling activity history.

       +o Suspend and resume scaling - Temporarily suspend and later resume au-
         tomatic scaling by calling the _R_e_g_i_s_t_e_r_S_c_a_l_a_b_l_e_T_a_r_g_e_t API action  for
         any Application Auto Scaling scalable target. You can suspend and re-
         sume (individually or in combination) scale-out activities  that  are
         triggered by a scaling policy, scale-in activities that are triggered
         by a scaling policy, and scheduled scaling.
