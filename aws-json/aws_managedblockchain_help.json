       Amazon  Managed  Blockchain is a fully managed service for creating and
       managing blockchain networks using open-source  frameworks.  Blockchain
       allows  you  to  build applications where multiple parties can securely
       and transparently run transactions and share data without the need  for
       a trusted, central authority.

       Managed   Blockchain  supports  the  Hyperledger  Fabric  and  Ethereum
       open-source frameworks. Because of fundamental differences between  the
       frameworks,  some  API actions or data types may only apply in the con-
       text of one framework and not the other. For example,  actions  related
       to  Hyperledger Fabric network members such as CCrreeaatteeMMeemmbbeerr and DDeelleettee--
       MMeemmbbeerr do not apply to Ethereum.

       The description for each action indicates the framework  or  frameworks
       to  which  it applies. Data types and properties that apply only in the
       context of a particular framework are similarly indicated.
