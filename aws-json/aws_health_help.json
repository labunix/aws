       The  AWS  Health API provides programmatic access to the AWS Health in-
       formation that appears in the _A_W_S _P_e_r_s_o_n_a_l _H_e_a_l_t_h _D_a_s_h_b_o_a_r_d .  You  can
       use  the API operations to get information about AWS Health events that
       affect your AWS services and resources.

       NNOOTTEE::
          You must have a Business or Enterprise support plan from _A_W_S _S_u_p_p_o_r_t
          to  use  the  AWS Health API. If you call the AWS Health API from an
          AWS account that doesn't have a Business or Enterprise support plan,
          you receive a SSuubbssccrriippttiioonnRReeqquuiirreeddEExxcceeppttiioonn error.

       AWS   Health  has  a  single  endpoint:  health.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
       (HTTPS). Use this endpoint to call the AWS Health API operations.

       For authentication of requests, AWS Health uses the _S_i_g_n_a_t_u_r_e _V_e_r_s_i_o_n _4
       _S_i_g_n_i_n_g _P_r_o_c_e_s_s .

       If  your  AWS account is part of AWS Organizations, you can use the AWS
       Health organizational view feature. This feature provides a centralized
       view of AWS Health events across all accounts in your organization. You
       can aggregate AWS Health events in real time to  identify  accounts  in
       your  organization that are affected by an operational event or get no-
       tified of security vulnerabilities. Use the organizational view API op-
       erations  to enable this feature and return event information. For more
       information, see _A_g_g_r_e_g_a_t_i_n_g _A_W_S _H_e_a_l_t_h _e_v_e_n_t_s in the _A_W_S  _H_e_a_l_t_h  _U_s_e_r

          When  you  use  the  AWS  Health API operations to return AWS Health
          events, see the following recommendations:

          +o Use the _e_v_e_n_t_S_c_o_p_e_C_o_d_e parameter to specify whether to return  AWS
            Health events that are public or account-specific.

          +o Use  pagination to view all events from the response. For example,
            if you call the DDeessccrriibbeeEEvveennttssFFoorrOOrrggaanniizzaattiioonn operation to get all
            events  in  your  organization, you might receive several page re-
            sults. Specify the nneexxttTTookkeenn in the next request  to  return  more
            results.
