       Amazon  Macie  Classic is a security service that uses machine learning
       to automatically discover, classify, and protect sensitive data in AWS.
       Macie Classic recognizes sensitive data such as personally identifiable
       information (PII) or intellectual property, and provides you with dash-
       boards  and alerts that give visibility into how this data is being ac-
       cessed or moved. For more information, see  the  _A_m_a_z_o_n  _M_a_c_i_e  _C_l_a_s_s_i_c
