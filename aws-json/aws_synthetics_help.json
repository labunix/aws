       You  can  use  Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics to continually monitor your
       services. You can create and  manage  _c_a_n_a_r_i_e_s  ,  which  are  modular,
       lightweight  scripts that monitor your endpoints and APIs from the out-
       side-in. You can set up your canaries to run 24 hours a day,  once  per
       minute.  The  canaries  help  you check the availability and latency of
       your web services and troubleshoot anomalies by investigating load time
       data, screenshots of the UI, logs, and metrics. The canaries seamlessly
       integrate with CloudWatch ServiceLens to help you trace the  causes  of
       impacted  nodes  in  your applications. For more information, see _U_s_i_n_g
