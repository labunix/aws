       Amazon  SimpleDB is a web service providing the core database functions
       of data indexing and querying in the cloud. By offloading the time  and
       effort  associated  with  building  and operating a web-scale database,
       SimpleDB provides developers the freedom to focus on application devel-
       opment.

       A traditional, clustered relational database requires a sizable upfront
       capital outlay, is complex to design, and often requires extensive  and
       repetitive  database  administration.  Amazon  SimpleDB is dramatically
       simpler, requiring no schema, automatically indexing your data and pro-
       viding  a  simple  API for storage and access. This approach eliminates
       the administrative burden of data modeling, index maintenance, and per-
       formance  tuning.  Developers  gain access to this functionality within
       Amazon's proven computing environment, are able to scale instantly, and
       pay only for what they use.
