       AWS  OpsWorks  for configuration management (CM) is a service that runs
       and manages configuration management servers. You can use AWS  OpsWorks
       CM to create and manage AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate and AWS OpsWorks
       for Puppet Enterprise servers, and add or remove nodes for the  servers
       to manage.

       +o SSeerrvveerr  : A configuration management server that can be highly-avail-
         able. The configuration management server runs on an  Amazon  Elastic
         Compute Cloud (EC2) instance, and may use various other AWS services,
         such as Amazon Relational Database Service  (RDS)  and  Elastic  Load
         Balancing.  A  server is a generic abstraction over the configuration
         manager that you want to use, much like Amazon RDS. In  AWS  OpsWorks
         CM,  you do not start or stop servers. After you create servers, they
         continue to run until they are deleted.

       +o EEnnggiinnee : The engine is the specific configuration  manager  that  you
         want  to  use.  Valid values in this release include CChheeffAAuuttoommaattee and
         PPuuppppeett .

       +o BBaacckkuupp : This is an application-level backup of  the  data  that  the
         configuration  manager  stores.  AWS OpsWorks CM creates an S3 bucket
         for backups when you launch the first server. A  backup  maintains  a
         snapshot  of  a server's configuration-related attributes at the time
         the backup starts.

       +o EEvveennttss : Events are always related to a server.  Events  are  written
         during server creation, when health checks run, when backups are cre-
         ated, when system maintenance is performed, etc. When  you  delete  a
         server, the server's events are also deleted.

       +o AAccccoouunntt  aattttrriibbuutteess  : Every account has attributes that are assigned
         in the AWS OpsWorks CM database. These attributes  store  information
         about configuration limits (servers, backups, etc.) and your customer
         account.

       AWS OpsWorks CM supports the following endpoints, all HTTPS.  You  must
       connect to one of the following endpoints. Your servers can only be ac-
       cessed or managed within the endpoint in which they are created.
