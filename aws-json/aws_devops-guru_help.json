       Amazon  DevOps  Guru is a fully managed service that helps you identify
       anomalous behavior in business critical operational  applications.  You
       specify  the AWS resources that you want DevOps Guru to cover, then the
       Amazon CloudWatch metrics and AWS CloudTrail events  related  to  those
       resources  are  analyzed.  When  anomalous behavior is detected, DevOps
       Guru creates an _i_n_s_i_g_h_t that includes recommendations, related  events,
       and related metrics that can help you improve your operational applica-
       tions. For more information, see _W_h_a_t _i_s _A_m_a_z_o_n _D_e_v_O_p_s _G_u_r_u .

       You can specify 1 or 2 Amazon Simple Notification Service topics so you
       are  notified  every time a new insight is created. You can also enable
       DevOps Guru to generate an OpsItem in AWS Systems Manager for each  in-
       sight to help you manage and track your work addressing insights.
