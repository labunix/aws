       Amazon Cognito Sync provides an AWS service and client library that en-
       able cross-device syncing of application-related user data.  High-level
       client  libraries  are  available for both iOS and Android. You can use
       these libraries to persist data locally so that it's available even  if
       the device is offline. Developer credentials don't need to be stored on
       the mobile device to access the service. You can use Amazon Cognito  to
       obtain  a normalized user ID and credentials. User data is persisted in
       a dataset that can store up to 1 MB of key-value  pairs,  and  you  can
       have up to 20 datasets per user identity.

       With Amazon Cognito Sync, the data stored for each identity is accessi-
       ble only to credentials assigned to that identity. In order to use  the
       Cognito  Sync service, you need to make API calls using credentials re-
       trieved with _A_m_a_z_o_n _C_o_g_n_i_t_o _I_d_e_n_t_i_t_y _s_e_r_v_i_c_e .

       If you want to use Cognito Sync in an Android or iOS  application,  you
       will  probably  want to make API calls via the AWS Mobile SDK. To learn
