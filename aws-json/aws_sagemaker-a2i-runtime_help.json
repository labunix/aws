          Amazon  Augmented AI is in preview release and is subject to change.
          We do not recommend using this product in production environments.

       Amazon Augmented AI (Amazon A2I) adds the benefit of human judgment  to
       any machine learning application. When an AI application can't evaluate
       data with a high degree of confidence, human reviewers can  take  over.
       This  human  review  is  called  a human review workflow. To create and
       start a human review workflow, you need three resources: a _w_o_r_k_e_r  _t_a_s_k
       _t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e , a _f_l_o_w _d_e_f_i_n_i_t_i_o_n , and a _h_u_m_a_n _l_o_o_p .

       For  information about these resources and prerequisites for using Ama-
       zon A2I, see _G_e_t _S_t_a_r_t_e_d _w_i_t_h _A_m_a_z_o_n _A_u_g_m_e_n_t_e_d _A_I in the  Amazon  Sage-
       Maker Developer Guide.

       This  API  reference  includes  information  about API actions and data
       types that you can use to interact with  Amazon  A2I  programmatically.
       Use this guide to:

       +o Start  a human loop with the SSttaarrttHHuummaannLLoooopp operation when using Ama-
         zon A2I with a _c_u_s_t_o_m _t_a_s_k _t_y_p_e . To learn more about the  difference
         between custom and built-in task types, see _U_s_e _T_a_s_k _T_y_p_e_s . To learn
         how to start a human loop using this API, see _C_r_e_a_t_e _a_n_d _S_t_a_r_t _a  _H_u_-
         _m_a_n  _L_o_o_p  _f_o_r  _a  _C_u_s_t_o_m _T_a_s_k _T_y_p_e in the Amazon SageMaker Developer
         Guide.

       +o Manage your human loops. You can list all human loops that  you  have
         created,  describe  individual human loops, and stop and delete human
         loops. To learn more, see _M_o_n_i_t_o_r _a_n_d _M_a_n_a_g_e _Y_o_u_r _H_u_m_a_n _L_o_o_p  in  the
         Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide.

       Amazon  A2I  integrates  APIs  from  various AWS services to create and
       start human review workflows for those services. To  learn  how  Amazon
       A2I uses these APIs, see _U_s_e _A_P_I_s _i_n _A_m_a_z_o_n _A_2_I in the Amazon SageMaker
       Developer Guide.
