       This  is  the CloudTrail API Reference. It provides descriptions of ac-
       tions, data types, common parameters, and common errors for CloudTrail.

       CloudTrail is a web service that records AWS API calls for your AWS ac-
       count  and  delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. The recorded in-
       formation includes the identity of the user, the start time of the  AWS
       API  call,  the  source IP address, the request parameters, and the re-
       sponse elements returned by the service.

       NNOOTTEE::
          As an alternative to the API, you can use one of the AWS SDKs, which
          consist  of  libraries  and sample code for various programming lan-
          guages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET,  iOS,  Android,  etc.).  The
          SDKs  provide  a  convenient  way  to  create programmatic access to
          AWSCloudTrail. For example, the SDKs take care of  cryptographically
          signing  requests,  managing errors, and retrying requests automati-
          cally. For information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download
          and install them, see the _T_o_o_l_s _f_o_r _A_m_a_z_o_n _W_e_b _S_e_r_v_i_c_e_s _p_a_g_e .

       is included with each AWS API call listed in the log files.
