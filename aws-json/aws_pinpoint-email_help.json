       The  Amazon  Pinpoint Email API is available in several AWS Regions and
       it provides an endpoint for each of these Regions. For a  list  of  all
       the Regions and endpoints where the API is currently available, see _A_W_S

       In each Region, AWS maintains multiple Availability Zones. These Avail-
       ability  Zones  are physically isolated from each other, but are united
       by private, low-latency, high-throughput, and highly redundant  network
       connections.  These  Availability  Zones enable us to provide very high
       levels of availability and redundancy, while also  minimizing  latency.
       To learn more about the number of Availability Zones that are available
       in each Region, see _A_W_S _G_l_o_b_a_l _I_n_f_r_a_s_t_r_u_c_t_u_r_e .
