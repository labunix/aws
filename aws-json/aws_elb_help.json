       A  load  balancer  can  distribute incoming traffic across your EC2 in-
       stances. This enables you to increase the availability of your applica-
       tion.  The load balancer also monitors the health of its registered in-
       stances and ensures that it routes traffic only to  healthy  instances.
       You configure your load balancer to accept incoming traffic by specify-
       ing one or more listeners, which are configured  with  a  protocol  and
       port  number  for  connections  from clients to the load balancer and a
       protocol and port number for connections from the load balancer to  the
       instances.

       Elastic Load Balancing supports three types of load balancers: Applica-
       tion Load Balancers, Network Load  Balancers,  and  Classic  Load  Bal-
       ancers. You can select a load balancer based on your application needs.
       For more information, see the _E_l_a_s_t_i_c _L_o_a_d _B_a_l_a_n_c_i_n_g _U_s_e_r _G_u_i_d_e .

       This reference covers the 2012-06-01 API, which supports  Classic  Load
       Balancers.  The  2015-12-01 API supports Application Load Balancers and
       Network Load Balancers.

       To get started, create a load balancer with one or more listeners using
       CreateLoadBalancer . Register your instances with the load balancer us-
       ing  RegisterInstancesWithLoadBalancer .

       All Elastic Load Balancing operations are _i_d_e_m_p_o_t_e_n_t , which means that
       they complete at most one time. If you repeat an operation, it succeeds
       with a 200 OK response code.
